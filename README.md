# What is this?

Roy Fielding's [REST dissertation](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm) reformatted to .epub.

# How to get it?

An .epub book is basically some HTML and metadata in a zip file.

* Download the [epub](https://github.com/downloads/csabapalfi/rest-epub/rest-dissertation.epub) I created

* or you can download the repository as [zip](https://github.com/csabapalfi/rest-epub/zipball/
master) then rename the file to .epub
